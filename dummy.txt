What is DevOps?
DevOps is a software development approach emphasizing collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery to provide high-quality products to customers quickly and efficiently. DevOps breaks down silos between development and operations teams to enable seamless communication, faster time-to-market, and improved customer satisfaction.

It allows a team to handle the complete application lifecycle, from development to testing, operations, and deployment. It shows cooperation between Development and Operations groups to deploy code to production quickly in an automated and repeatable manner.

Every phase of the software development lifecycle, including planning, coding, testing, deployment, and monitoring, is heavily automated in DevOps. This improves productivity, ensures consistency, and lowers error rates in the development process. A culture of continuous improvement is also promoted by DevOps, where feedback loops are incorporated into the procedure to facilitate quicker iteration and better decision-making. Organizations can increase their agility, lower costs, and speed up innovation by adopting DevOps.
